# ðŸš¦ Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Smart City Traffic Optimization

##  Overview
This repository presents an intelligent traffic signal control system powered by **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to optimize traffic flow in smart cities. Traditional fixed-time and actuated signal systems struggle to adapt to dynamic congestion patterns. By leveraging DRL, this project enables real-time traffic signal adjustments that improve mobility, reduce waiting time, and minimize overall congestion.

The system is implemented in **Python** using the **CityFlow** traffic simulator and the **traffic-signal-control dataset**.

---

##  Objectives
- Develop an adaptive DRL-based traffic signal control framework.
- Reduce **average waiting time, queue length, and travel time**.
- Compare performance against traditional fixed-time traffic systems.
- Demonstrate system scalability for **smart city applications**.
